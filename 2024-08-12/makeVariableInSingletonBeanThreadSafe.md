The `isSet` field in `MySingleton` can be made thread-safe by ensuring that access to it is properly synchronized or by using atomic operations.

```java
@Component
public class MySingleton {

    private volatile boolean isSet = false;

    public boolean isSet() {
        return isSet;
    }

    public void setIsSet() {
        this.isSet = true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Thread Safety:

1. **Volatile Keyword:**
   - The `volatile` keyword ensures that changes to the `isSet` variable are visible to all threads immediately. This means that when one thread updates `isSet`, any other thread reading the value will see the updated value immediately.
   - However, `volatile` does not provide atomicity for compound actions (like checking and setting). In scenarios where you need to check and set the value atomically, `volatile` alone isn't sufficient.

2. **Thread Safety Concern:**
   - The `isSet()` method is safe because it only reads the value of the `volatile` variable.
   - The `setIsSet()` method is also thread-safe in terms of visibility, but if you need to perform a check-and-set operation atomically (e.g., "if not shutting down, then set to shutting down"), this code is not thread-safe.

### Making the `isSet` Field Thread-Safe:

To make the check-and-set operation thread-safe, you can use `synchronized` methods or an `AtomicBoolean`:

#### 1. **Using `synchronized` Methods:**
   ```java
   @Component
   public class MySingleton {

       private boolean isSet = false;

       public synchronized boolean isSet() {
           return isSet;
       }

       public synchronized void setIsSet() {
           this.isSet = true;
       }
   }
   ```
   - The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can execute these methods at a time, which makes the check-and-set operation thread-safe.

#### 2. **Using `AtomicBoolean`:**
   ```java
   @Component
   public class MySingleton {

       private final AtomicBoolean isSet = new AtomicBoolean(false);

       public boolean isSet() {
           return isSet.get();
       }

       public void setIsSet() {
           isSet.set(true);
       }

       public boolean compareAndsetIsSet(boolean expected, boolean newValue) {
           return isSet.compareAndSet(expected, newValue);
       }
   }
   ```
   - `AtomicBoolean` provides atomic operations like `get()`, `set()`, and `compareAndSet()` which are thread-safe. `compareAndSet()` can be particularly useful for ensuring that only one thread can successfully change the state from `false` to `true`.

### Conclusion:

- **If you need to perform simple read and write operations,** the `volatile` keyword is sufficient.
- **If you need to perform atomic check-and-set operations,** using `AtomicBoolean` or `synchronized` methods is necessary to ensure thread safety.

Both approaches will prevent race conditions and ensure that your shutdown logic behaves correctly in a multi-threaded environment.
